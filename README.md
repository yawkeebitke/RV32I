# RV32I Core (Practice Project)
A simple RISC-V 32-bit CPU core implementation in Verilog, created for learning purposes.  
**Note**: This is a personal practice project — expect non-optimized code and possible bugs!  

## ❓ What's This?
- A minimal RV32I core implementation(basic instructions).
- Focused on understanding CPU architecture, not production-ready code.

# Other messages
This is one of my simple practice projects, part of a RISC-V 32-bit CPU core. I guess?
Anyway,the project and the code is always available to download and use.
But I'm not a professional engineer,so the verilog code may have some bugs as you can see.
Have a good time!
